      <p>Thank you for visiting my art! 
      I am a full-time independent illustrator and designer. 
      I also freelance for publishing, animation, and games.</p>
      <h2>Things You May Know Me From...</h2>
      <p>I was a background painter at Disney TV Animation from 2015-2018, 
      and I have done illustration and visual development work for clients/projects 
      that include Dreamworks TV, Disney Publishing, Lucasfilm Press, 
      Dark Horse Comics, Marvel Snap, Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast 
      (Magic the Gathering), Harper Collins, Amazon Audible, and many more 
      publishers. I do not sell my work as NFT’s and do not condone any sale 
      of my work as NFT’s. Any NFT you may find online made from my artwork 
      are fraudulent and infringing on my copyright, in violation of the law. I do 
      not sell my work on any other websites besides ones 
      linked under my own name. </p>
